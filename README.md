# 🏴‍☠️ Capture The Flag (CTF) Writeups & Scripts

This repository contains my personal collection of CTF challenges, writeups, and tools used to solve them.  
It serves as both a learning record and a resource for others exploring cybersecurity concepts like reverse engineering, forensics, web exploitation, cryptography, and privilege escalation.
